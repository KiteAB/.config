# `.config`

Personal configuration file repository (mainly used for backup)

If you want to use some configuration files that I have removed, maybe you'll be interested in [this repository](https://github.com/theniceboy/.config)

Hint: My operating system is [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org), if your system is others such as [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com), you may can't use this config.
